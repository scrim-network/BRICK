#  -This program loads in temperature and ocean heat data for use in DOECLIM model
#       and uncertainty calculations:
#		+ surface temperature, HadCRUT4 global means (1850-2012), Morice et al (2012)
#		+ ocean heat, 0-3000 m (1953-1996), Gouretski and Koltermann (2007)
#
#   -NOTE: This file contains data that is sourced into the other programs. Information
#       regarding this data can be found below:
#
#       -RCP8.5 is used to create temperature simulations to 2300
#       -RCP8.5 simulates "Business as usual" and is similar to the A2 scenario
#       -The RCP8.5 temperatures are from the CNRM-CM5 model
#           (Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques)
#       -These RCP8.5 temperatures closly resemble historical temperatures
#           from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
#
#       -Annual global land and ocean temperature anomalies (C)
#       -Anomalies with respect to the 20th century average
