# BRICK v0.3 ![alt text](https://github.com/scrim-network/BRICK/blob/master/brick_logo.png "This is a brick!")

## Synopsis

BRICK (**B**uilding blocks for **R**elevant **I**ce and **C**limate **K**nowledge) is a modular semi-empirical modeling framework to simulate global temperature and sea-level rise. In the default model configuration, first, global mean surface temperature and ocean heat uptake are simulated by DOECLIM. Changes in global mean surface temperature drive changes in global mean sea level (GMSL). The contributions to GMSL from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, thermal expansion, and glaciers and ice caps are simulated.

This repository contains the BRICK model source code and analysis scripts. Analysis codes and the main user interface are written in R and the main physics codes are in Fortran 90.

It contains the sub-models
* DOECLIM (Diffusion-Ocean-Energy CLIMate model)
* SNEASY (Simple Nonlinear EArth SYstem model)
* DAIS (Antarctic ice sheet)
* SIMPLE (Greenland ice sheet)
* GSIC-MAGICC (Glaciers and small ice caps)
* TE (thermal expansion)

### An important note:

The `master` branch contains the latest and greatest codes, including bug fixes and code enhancements relative to the model versions used in the [Wong et al 2017](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303) and [Bakker et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04134-5) studies.

Codes for these other studies may be found in the branches (e.g., `BRICKms` and `robustslr` for the ones mentioned above), or external repositories when noted. Thus, using codes from the `master` branch is advised.

## Directory structure

./
   * BRICK "home" directory

./calibration/
   * R scripts related to the calibration of the physical models, including reading data and  likelihood functions

./data/
   * data for radiative forcing and calibration

./fortran/
   * Fortran versions of all physical models are available, and are wrapped in R calling functions in ./fortran/R/

## Motivation

The motivation for the BRICK model is detailed in the [model description paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303/):

> Here we introduce BRICK v0.1 ("Building blocks for Relevant Ice and Climate Knowledge"), a new model framework that focuses on accessibility, transparency, and flexibility while maintaining, as much as possible, the computational efficiency that make simple models so appealing. There is a wide range of potential applications for such a model. A simple framework enables uncertainty quantification via statistical calibration approaches (Higdon et al., 2004; Kennedy and Oâ€™Hagan, 2001), which would be infeasible with more computationally expensive models. A transparent modeling framework enables communication between scientists as well as communication with stakeholders. This leads to potential application of the model framework in decision support and education (Weaver et al., 2013). The present work expands on previous studies by (1) providing a platform of simple, but mechanistically motivated sea-level process models that resolve more processes, (2) providing a model framework that can facilitate model comparisons (for example, between our models and those of Nauels et al. (2016)), (3) exploring combined effects of key structural and parametric uncertainties, (4) explicitly demonstrating the flexibility of our framework for interchanging model components, and (5) explicitly demonstrating the utility of our model framework for informing decision analyses.

## Installation

To obtain the model codes:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/scrim-network/BRICK.git
~~~~

The calibrated parameter files are larger than we prefer to move around with the Github repository codes. The parameter files that correspond to the [model description paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303/) are available from [this download server](https://download.clima.psu.edu/Wong_etal_BRICK/). Of course, the ambitious user is invited to run his/her own calibrations, as detailed in the workflow below.

The following R packages are required. Within the workflow detailed below, there is a script to install all of these, so no need to copy-paste. Note that each command is issued separately so that if one throws an error, it is immediately obvious where the problem lies. Also note that if these packages are already installed and/or loaded in R, you will receive many error messages and requests to restart R before proceeding with package updates.

## Code Example: Projecting local sea level

Suppose you would like to use the sea level projections from the [BRICK model description paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303/) in your own work. The following example will demonstrate how to use these projections and fingerprint the global sea level contributions to local mean sea level rise. This process is automated in the R function `BRICK_projectLocalSeaLevel.R`.

1. Checkout the model codes and download the projections from the [BRICK model description paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303/). If you do not have `curl`, you can either install it using `sudo apt-get install curl`, or use `wget`, or - if all else fails - navigate to the URL below to download the relevant results files.
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/scrim-network/BRICK.git
cd BRICK/output_model
curl -O https://download.scrim.psu.edu/Wong_etal_BRICK/BRICK-model_physical_control_02Apr2017.nc
~~~~

2. Open R, and navigate to the BRICK directory containing the `BRICK_LSL.R` script. You may need to replace the directory path below with the corresponding R subdirectory within your own BRICK directory.
~~~~
R
setwd('~/codes/BRICK/R')
~~~~

3. Set a latitude and longitude at which you want to project local mean sea level. Here, we demonstrate using Key West, Florida (24.5551 deg N, 81.7800 deg W).
~~~~
lat <- 24.5551
lon <- -81.7800
~~~~

4. Read in the projections of the major contributions to global mean sea level for the control ensemble presented in the [BRICK model description paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2016-303/). Here, we demonstrate using RCP8.5.
~~~~
library(ncdf4)
filename.projections <- '../output_model/BRICK-model_physical_control_02Apr2017.nc'
ncdata <- nc_open(filename.projections)
slr.gsic <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'GSIC_RCP85')
slr.gis <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'GIS_RCP85')
slr.ais <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'AIS_RCP85')
slr.te <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'TE_RCP85')
slr.lws <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'LWS_RCP85')
t.proj <- ncvar_get(ncdata, 'time_proj')
n.ens <- length(ncvar_get(ncdata, 'ens'))
nc_close(ncdata)
~~~~

5. Use the `BRICK_LSL.R` script to project local mean sea level.
~~~~
source('BRICK_LSL.R')
lsl.proj <- brick_lsl(lat.in=lat, lon.in=lon, n.time=length(t.proj), slr_gis=slr.gis, slr_gsic=slr.gsic, slr_ais=slr.ais, slr_te=slr.te, slr_lws=slr.lws)
~~~~

6. Write output to a netCDF file
~~~~
filename.output <- '../output_model/BRICK_LSL_KeyWest_RCP85.nc'
dim.tproj <- ncdim_def('time_proj', 'years', as.double(t.proj))
dim.ensemble <- ncdim_def('ens', 'ensemble member', as.double(1:n.ens), unlim=TRUE)
lsl.rcp85 <- ncvar_def('LocalSeaLevel_RCP85', 'meters', list(dim.tproj, dim.ensemble), -999, longname = 'Local sea level (RCP85)')
outnc <- nc_create(filename.output, list(lsl.rcp85), force_v4 = TRUE)
ncvar_put(outnc, lsl.rcp85, lsl.proj)
nc_close(outnc)
~~~~

7. *Reflection:* Note that the same result would be achieved by running `BRICK_projectLocalSeaLevel`, as demonstrated below. NB: this include normalization of local sea level to 1986-2005 period. Also, this function includes RCP26, 45 and 85, as well as the ensemble global mean temperatures and ocean heat uptake.
~~~~
source('BRICK_projectLocalSeaLevel.R')
rc <- BRICK_projectLocalSeaLevel(lat.in=24.5551, lon.in=-81.7800,
    filename.brickin='../output_model/BRICK-model_physical_control_02Apr2017.nc',
    filename.brickout='../output_model/BRICK_LSL_KeyWest_RCP85.nc')
~~~~

## Workflow

### To reproduce the work of Wong, Bakker et al., 2017 (model description paper)

1. Checkout the model codes. Specifically, the `BRICKms` branch reproduces the model description paper. (Note that the `master` branch does not include many of these experimental codes, and that the `BRICKms` branch will not be supported long-term here.)
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/scrim-network/BRICK.git
git checkout BRICKms
~~~~

2. Create the dynamic libraries necessary to run the model in Fortran. You might need to modify the `Makefile` to use your preferred Fortran compiler. Further help can be found at `BRICK/fortran/README`.
~~~~
cd BRICK/fortran
mkdir obj
make
~~~~

3. Open R and install the relevant R packages.
~~~~
R
setwd('BRICK/calibration')
source('BRICK_install_packages.R')
~~~~

4. Calibrate the default BRICK model configuration (DOECLIM+SIMPLE+GSIC+TE) parameters using modern data. This should not take longer than an hour or two on a modern multi-core computer.
~~~~
source('BRICK_calib_driver.R')
~~~~

5. Calibrate the DAIS parameters using paleoclimate data. This will take about 12 hours with a modern laptop.
~~~~
source('DAIS_calib_driver.R')
~~~~

6. Calibrate global mean sea-level rise model parameters using modern data and the Rahmstorf 2007 model.
~~~~
source('BRICK_calib_driver_R07.R')
~~~~

7. Calibrate the SIMPLE-GSIC parameters using modern data.
~~~~
source('BRICK_calib_driver_SIMPLE-GSIC.R')
~~~~

8. Combine modern and paleo calibration parameters, and calibrate the joint set to sea level data using rejection sampling; make hindcasts and projections of sea level; project local sea level and assess flood risks for the control model configuration. Note: if you run your own calibrations, files names must be edited to point to the correct files. By default, they point to the file names as used in the GMDD model description paper. To fully reproduce all of the experiments from that work, you must run the following script three times, where `experiment` is set to (i) c (control), (ii) e (SIMPLE-GSIC), and (iii) g (BRICK-GMSL).
~~~~
source('processingPipeline_BRICKexperiments.R')
~~~~

9. Create plots and analysis, as seen in the GMDD description paper. Note: file names must be edited to point to the correct files, if you have run your own calibrations. Also note: the directory in which you save the plots must be changed to match somewhere on your own machine.
~~~~
source('analysis_and_plots_BRICKexperiments.R')
~~~~

Note that in each of these scripts, some edits will be necessary. These will include pointing at the proper file names. The BRICK and DAIS calibration driver scripts produce calibrated parameter files with date-stamps in their names. You will need to make sure the processing pipeline script points at the current calibrated parameters files. The processing pipeline script, in turn, produces several netCDF output files from your fully calibrated BRICK parameters. These file names also include date-stamps. You will need to make sure the analysis and plotting script points at the current files. You will also need to modify the directory in which your plots will be saved.
